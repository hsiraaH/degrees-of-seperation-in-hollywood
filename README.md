Program to find the degrees of separation between two Hollywood artists. This is inspired from The Six Degrees Of Kevin Bacon Game. You can input any two Hollywood Artist names (can even be from a long time ago). The program will output you the shortest path of seperation between them.

For example, if I wanted to find out the Degrees of seperation between Emma Mackey and Emma Watson.
